    Zombie Dice Bots

    Makes game playing AI's?

    **On each players turn**
    1. Place all 13 dice in a cup. Player randomly draws 3 dice from cup and rolls them.
       Players always roll 3 Dice.
    2.Set aside count up any brains(humans brains who were eaten) and shotguns(humans who
    fought back). Accumulating 3 shotguns automatically ends a player's turn with zero points,(
    regardless of how many brains they had). If they had 0-2 shotguns they can continue rolling
    if they want. They may also choose to end their turn and collect one point per brain.
    3. If the player decides to keep rollign they must reroll all dice with footsteps. Remember
    that the player must always roll 3 dice; they must draw more dice out of the cup if they have 
    fewer than three footsteps to roll. A player may keep rolling dice until either they get three
    shotguns-- losing everythin-- or all 13 dice have been rolled. A player may not reroll only
    one or two dice, and may not stop mid-reroll.
    4. When someone reaches 13 brains, the rest of the players finish out the round. THe person
    with the most brains wins. If there's a tie, the tied players play one last tiebreaker round.
